1) In the event of a disagreement we will discuss internally. After 15mins if no conclusion has been made we will call in a third party (fellow, instructor, etc)
Set vote/
2) When a memember of our group is frustrated we should be open and upfront if anything is bothering the individual. Teammates should all listen and be sure the person who brought up any issue is heard. If someone needs time they can take some time away from the group to reflect.
Address any issues immediately and directly/
3) What do we do when we merge our work together?
We will all merge 2 times a day minimum, morning after REACTOs and night before we leave for the evening. At any point during the day if we have a pull request, all members should pull from master at that time.
4) When does our group ask for help?
After 15-20mins of productive struggle we will ask a fellow or instructor for help. Don't fear help tickets!
5) When do we pair program?
Always ask for help from teammates when needed. If you are taking on a more difficult feature during standup mention if you'd like someone to pair program at that time. When pair programming we will be switching the driver/navigator about every 15mins. Always add, commit, push to the branch whenever trading places.
6) How does this group work after hours?
Yes we will work after hours when necessary. We will communicate via Slack when we are working on certain features and always ask to have someone approve your PRs when we are not together. Keep an eye on Waffle 2 times a day for new PRs(morning/night).
Assign tickets together, at the end of the day do a discussion of tickets we've assigned./
7) Dail standup time?
Daily standup will be held at 11:30am with our fellow.
